# üéÆ [Stalker XRay-TS template](README.md)

Enabling power of typescript for scripting and dynamic configuration. <br/>
Completely different way of XRay mods creation.

## üìåWhat is used

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [ts-node](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/) for scripting
- [TypeScriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/docs/getting-started) for transpiling to LUA
- [Open-X-Ray](https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16) for improved core game performance and APIs
- Custom [build system](cli/README.md) for `gamedata` building
- Custom tools and JSX for XML files generation

## üìç Purposes

Main goals of the project are:

- type safety
- unified tools for mod development
- automated builds steps and versioning system
- build-level globals to reduce amount of magical constants in codebase
- shared template for mods development
- documented code that can be used by others without searching forums from 2000s
- creating development tools to simplify life
- fun

---

## ü•¶ Main differences with original

Intention is to create base template without breaking changes to the game story.

- Game codebase is unified and refactored with typescript
- Separate verification and preparation steps added instead of direct ltx/xml/script files editing
- Dev tools added for easier mod debugging and development, always can be turned off for release versions of mods

# üåì Starting work

## üß∞ Pre-requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- `cli/config.json` file should be edited, paths matched to your local system

## üíø Start development

- DOWNLOAD the game (stalker call of pripyat)
- EDIT `cli/config.json` - correct paths to match your local system
- RUN `cd stalker-xrts-template` - cd to project folder
- RUN `npm install` - install all the dependencies
- RUN `npm run link` - link gamedata to the game folder
- RUN `npm run build` - build gamedata to the destination
- RUN `npm run engine use release` - link open xray with game
- RUN `npm run start_game` - start game and test changes

## üß∞ Check issues

`$ npm run verify` - will check whether project is set up and ready to start developing

# üß∞ Developing

## üèóÔ∏è Project commands

`$ npm run COMMAND_NAME`

- [info](cli/info/README.md) - print general information about project and configuration
- [verify](cli/verify/README.md) - verify project settings and readiness
- [link](cli/link/README.md) - link target/gamedata and logs folder and stalker folder for faster development
- [unlink](cli/build/README.md) - unlink target/gamedata and logs folder and stalker folder
- [engine](cli/build/README.md) - engine management commands to use open-xray
- [open_game_folder](cli/build/README.md) - open game folder in explorer
- [start_game](cli/build/README.md) - start game with debug flag
- [build](cli/build/README.md) - build project gamedata with all assets
- [build:clean](cli/build/README.md) - same as build, but with `--clean` flag
- `format` - reformat TS code and lint it
- `lint` - lint TS code with eslint utils

## üèóÔ∏è Code style

For code style unification and validation prettier and eslint are used. <br/>
Line endings are set to CRLF to match windows system.

## üß∞ Typescript

Core of this project is [TypeScriptToLua](https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua). <br/>
Even if you see simple typescript, in does not mean that it will work as javascript in all cases. It has some specifics.

---

- Typescript to lua compilation does not do tree shaking
- Use LuaTable/LuaMap classes where possible, avoid inline JS arrays and objects
- To prevent bloated codebase avoid index files usage and re-exporting
- Do not use window/dom/document/global APIs in lua scripts / shared mod libs, they are not transpiled to Lua

---

To work correctly with conflicting keywords and luabind classes custom utils are provided:

- Build [plugin](cli/build/plugins) to support keyword `super` as `xr_class_super`
- `lua_globals.script` and `_g.script` to supply global functions that can be used from global context by typescript
- Custom [typedefs](src/typedefs) to support functions call from Lua global context (xray engine, lua libs)

## üèóÔ∏è Mod gamedata folder structure

todo: Describe structure of gamedata and intention of every folder

- `ai`
- `anims`
- `configs`
- `levels`
- `meshes`
- `scripts`
- `shaders`
- `sounds`
- `spawns`
- `textures`

## üß∞ Custom forms and UI

Notes:

- When creating forms, use [JSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html)
- When mod compilation happens, JSX is transformed to valid XML
- All coordinates with (x, y) are based on 'attach' parent (not XML child, rather script register parent) and related
- Use `preview` command to preview forms and develop faster, example: `npm run preview menu`

For examples check: `src/mod/ui`.

## üèóÔ∏è Development utils

[Can be checked here.](UTILS.md)

## üß∞ Main todos

- Move remaining logic and codebase to typescript
- After migration consider simplification and unification of some parts
- Finish LTX generation tools
- Finish translation generation tools
- Create electron application to simplify development of dialogs, labels, translations, asset management etc
- Scripts to unpack raw_gamedata for observation / usage
- Script to verify integrity of assets and defined constants
- Screenshots of some tools
- Typescript / c++ cooperation comments
- Strip log:info / log:error with TSTL plugin?
- Declare luaBind classes with TSTL plugin?
- Use modules instead of global scope for typedefs folder (no-resolve + declare types packages)
- Rework acdc perl script and add all.spawn editing utils
- Unit tests and mocks?
